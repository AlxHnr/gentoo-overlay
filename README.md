This is my personal Gentoo overlay. You can install it using layman:

`sudo layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlxHnr/gentoo-overlay/master/repository.xml -f -a alxhnr`

It contains the following packages:

* [dlaunch](https://github.com/AlxHnr/Dlaunch) - A simple, learning dmenu
wrapper
* [chicken-builder](https://github.com/AlxHnr/chicken-builder) - A
makefile generator for CHICKEN projects
* [alx-tools](https://github.com/AlxHnr/alx-tools) - A collection of
various scripts and hacks
