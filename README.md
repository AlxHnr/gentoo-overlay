# AlxHnr's Gentoo overlay

This is my personal Gentoo overlay. You can install it using layman:

`sudo layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlxHnr/gentoo-overlay/master/repository.xml -f -a alxhnr`

It contains the following packages:

  * [Dlaunch](https://github.com/AlxHnr/Dlaunch) - A simple, learning dmenu
    wrapper
  * [chicken-builder](https://github.com/AlxHnr/chicken-builder) - A
    makefile generator for CHICKEN projects
